# Week4.1
Week 4 assignment 4.1
This week I created a main page (index.html) and a blog page. The other pages are still in progress. The Main page should showcase my most recent art, and the blog page will show all my art posted. There is a header with navigation, and a footer. There is a spot for a logo in the top left corner.
